Concept: Welding Geometry.

Internal structure as bones + external welding surface as skins.

in the internal: bar bones or thin mesh formwork
in the external: welding patterns, voronoi or chainmail


Demo1: flat surface with internal and external (Dim: 200mm*200mm)
Demo2: Three bar bones with simple surface pattern (Dim: 200mm*200mm, Height: 200mm)
